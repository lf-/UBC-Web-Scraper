Students who are majoring in a related degree program (e.g. BFA Acting, English with a focus on drama) can register with permission of the instructor.This course examines age as an identity category as expressed through theatre and performance. Culture shapes our normative expectations of how we experience and articulate various ages across the lifecourse. Entrenched ideas about how we should \u0018act our age\u0019 limit not just the elderly, but all ages. Through engaging with the growing field of critical age studies, as well as with theatre and performance studies, this course offers students the opportunity to examine and interrogate constructions of age identity through considering related topics such as temporality, aesthetics, embodiment, rhetoric, stereotypes and stock figures, memory, and age performance and performativity.","subject_code":"THTR","course_number":"445","section_number":"001","building":"Irving K Barber Learning Centre","room":"460","instructors":["HENDERSON, JULIA"],"totalRemaining":"9","currentlyRegistered":"6","generalRemaining":"0","restrictedRemaining":"9"}},"credits":"Credits: 3","description":" "},"449":{"course_name":"THTR 449","subject_code":"THTR","course_number":"449","course_title":"Supervised Study and Honours Essay","course_link":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-course&dept=THTR&course=449","sections":{"001":{"status":"Blocked","section":"THTR 449 001","href":"/cs/courseschedule?pname=subjarea&tname=subj-section&dept=THTR&course=449&section=001","activity":"Directed Studies","term":"1-2","interval":"","days":" ","start":" ","end":" ","comments":"Permission of the Department is required to enroll in this course.

This course will focus on artists' publishing, known as printed matter, from the 1960s to the present. It's also a hands-on seminar and will offer multiple perspectives on content, production and circulation of this art form. Printed matter includes artists' books, folders, pamphlets, zines, journals, posters, announcements and other ephemera. We will investigate the role of printed matter within a wide art context. In the course students will be provided with substantial exposure to this art form, making it and speaking about it while developing their critical thinking. We will be looking at, talking about and making. This will happen through our presentations of printed matter, discussions, workshop time and class visitors.","subject_code":"VISA","course_number":"370","section_number":"001","building":"B.C.

Although the emphasis will be on lens-based image making and image taking, the use of any medium is encouraged. The primary thematic focus will be on the ideas of portraiture and self-portraiture and the many ways the human figure can be examined, including through performance, narrative and documentary.

Humour, comedy, jokes, and laughter will become serious, offensive, perhaps even painful, and may become unfunny. You will question why you laugh, why you didn\u0019t, how you laugh, when you laugh, if it is okay to laugh, and how much you endorse what you laugh at. The course also covers the contradictions, types, superiority, incongruity and relief in humour and the various theories from tragedy to irony to play. The purpose of this course is to tie the ways in which art uses humour, can evolve, and the ways in which art is much like humour in the way it functions and performs.\u001cHigh seriousness and high humour are the same thing\u001d --  Robert SmithsonPlease note that online registration in 400 level VISA courses is restricted to approved and declared VISA Majors and Honours students.
